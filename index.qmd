I'm Xingyu Zhong (钟星宇), an undergraduate student major in Mathematics at Beijing Institute of Technology (enrolled in 2022). 

My mathematical interest rise from competitive programming, of which I had been a participant from the primary school to the college. Algbra, combinatorics and formalization of mathematics fascinate me the most. As a recreational event, I like experimenting with academic publishing systems, being an everyday user of LaTeX, Markdown, Pandoc and Quarto.
